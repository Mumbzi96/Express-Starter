# Design Structure
When you first use this as a template, you should go to the test router and check all the routes it has, those are all examples/templates to use for your project (provided you're using express-handlebars).

## Layouts
The project has 3 layouts:
- Main: This is used for all your pages as your default layout
- Login
- Signup

## Main/Test
In that folder, you'll find a list of handlebars files that can be used according the specified reason.

## Partials/X
Every folder and file in the partials file is a css or a javascript partial used in the templates mentioned above EXCEPT the components folder which simply contains a flash message that you'll need to give values through your route to it
